MAT 128B Project 2: Using algebraic methods for optimization: backpropagation neural networks

i-Load the dataset

ii- Plot digits. Tryout the first example using the code in 17(a). We can get exactly what on the text book.

Then, compute the average digit using command T(1,:) = mean(train0), T(2,:) = mean(train1);etc and plot them,
we get the image shown on the book.
